# Linear MCP Server Tool Standardization

## Executive Summary

This document provides an overview of the Linear MCP Server Tool Standardization initiative. The goal is to establish and implement consistent rules across all tools in the Linear MCP Server, improving user experience, code maintainability, and overall quality.

## Standardization Rules

### Rule 1: Concise Tool Descriptions
Tool descriptions should be concise and focus only on the tool's purpose and functionality, without listing parameters or explaining the result format.

### Rule 2: Flexible Object Identifier Resolution
Input arguments that reference Linear objects should accept multiple forms of identification (UUID, name, key) and resolve them to the underlying UUID using consistent resolution methods.

### Rule 3: Consistent Entity Rendering
Tools fetching the same entities should emit results using the same format, with additional fields added at the bottom. This includes:

1. **Full Entity Rendering**: When displaying an entity as the primary subject of a response, use a consistent format with all required fields.
2. **Entity Identifier Rendering**: When referencing an entity from another entity, use a consistent, concise identifier format.

### Rule 4: Field Superset for Retrieval Methods
The fields rendered on retrieval methods should follow a consistent pattern:
- **Detail retrieval methods** must include all fields that can be set through create/update methods
- **Overview retrieval methods** only need to include key metadata fields
This ensures appropriate level of detail while maintaining consistency across the API.

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**
   - Consistent behavior across all tools
   - More flexible parameter handling
   - Standardized output format

2. **Enhanced Code Maintainability**
   - Shared utility functions for common operations
   - Reduced code duplication
   - Consistent patterns across the codebase

3. **Better Quality**
   - Standardized error handling
   - Consistent validation
   - Comprehensive testing

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1: Create Shared Utility Functions**
   - Develop common identifier resolution functions
   - Create entity rendering functions
   - Establish consistent patterns

2. **Phase 2: Update Tools**
   - Update each tool to follow the standardization rules
   - Start with one tool as a reference implementation
   - Apply the same patterns to all remaining tools

3. **Phase 3: Update Tests**
   - Update test fixtures to reflect the new formatting
   - Add tests for the new utility functions
   - Verify all tests pass with the new implementation

## Timeline and Resources

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Create Shared Utility Functions | 1 day | None |
| Phase 2: Update Tools | 3 days | Phase 1 |
| Phase 3: Update Tests | 1 day | Phase 2 |
| **Total** | **5 days** | |

## Success Criteria

The standardization effort will be considered successful when:

1. All tool descriptions are concise and focused on functionality
2. All tools that reference Linear objects accept multiple identifier types
3. All tools render entities in a consistent format
4. Retrieval methods include all fields that can be set in create/update methods
5. Code reuse is maximized through shared functions
6. All tests pass with the new implementation

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the standardization requirements
2. Begin implementation of Phase 1 (Shared Utility Functions)
3. Select a tool to serve as the reference implementation
4. Implement changes for all tools
5. Update tests and verify functionality

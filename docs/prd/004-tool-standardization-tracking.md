## Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to track the implementation of each rule for each tool:

### Rule 1: Concise Tool Descriptions

- [x] linear_create_issue
- [x] linear_update_issue
- [x] linear_search_issues
- [x] linear_get_user_issues
- [x] linear_get_issue
- [x] linear_add_comment
- [x] linear_get_teams

### Rule 2: Flexible Object Identifier Resolution

- [x] linear_create_issue (already implemented)
- [x] linear_update_issue
- [x] linear_search_issues
- [x] linear_get_user_issues
- [x] linear_get_issue
- [x] linear_add_comment
- [x] linear_get_teams (no identifiers needed)

### Rule 3: Consistent Entity Rendering

#### Full Entity Rendering
- [x] linear_create_issue
- [x] linear_update_issue
- [x] linear_search_issues
- [x] linear_get_user_issues
- [x] linear_get_issue
- [x] linear_add_comment
- [x] linear_get_teams

#### Entity Identifier Rendering
- [x] linear_create_issue (for referenced entities)
- [x] linear_update_issue (for referenced entities)
- [x] linear_search_issues (for referenced entities)
- [x] linear_get_user_issues (for referenced entities)
- [x] linear_get_issue (for referenced entities)
- [x] linear_add_comment (for referenced entities)
- [x] linear_get_teams (for referenced entities)

### Rule 4: Field Superset for Retrieval Methods

#### Detail Retrieval Methods
- [x] linear_get_issue (must include all fields from create_issue and update_issue)
- [x] linear_get_issue (must include all necessary comment fields from add_comment)

#### Overview Retrieval Methods
- [x] linear_get_user_issues (must include key metadata fields)
- [x] linear_search_issues (must include key metadata fields)
- [x] linear_get_teams (must include all team fields that can be referenced)

## Notes and Issues

Use this section to track any issues or notes that arise during implementation:

1. The formatTeamIdentifier function expects a pointer to a Team, but the GetTeams function returns a slice of Team values. We had to create a pointer to each team in the loop.
2. Tests need to be updated to reflect the new formatting of results.
3. Parameter names have been updated to be more consistent with the entity they represent:
   - `id` → `issue` in linear_update_issue
   - `issueId` → `issue` in linear_get_issue and linear_add_comment
   - `teamId` → `team` in linear_search_issues (already done)
   - `userId` → `user` in linear_get_user_issues (already done)
   - `assigneeId` → `assignee` in linear_search_issues (already done)

## Next Steps

The following tasks have been completed for the Tool Standardization initiative:

1. **Rule 1: Concise Tool Descriptions** ✅
   - All tool descriptions have been updated to be concise and focused on functionality

2. **Rule 2: Flexible Object Identifier Resolution** ✅
   - All tools now accept multiple forms of identification for Linear objects

3. **Rule 3: Consistent Entity Rendering** ✅
   - All tools now use consistent formatting for entity rendering
   - Shared formatting functions have been implemented

4. **Rule 4: Field Superset for Retrieval Methods** ✅
   - Detail retrieval methods now include all fields that can be set in create/update methods
   - Overview retrieval methods include appropriate metadata fields
   - The displayIconURL parameter has been removed from add_comment

Future enhancements could include:

1. Adding more comprehensive tests for the resolution functions
2. Documenting the standardized approach in the project README
3. Applying similar standardization patterns to any new tools added in the future

# Project Brief: Linear MCP Server

## Overview
Linear MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Linear, written in Go. It provides tools for interacting with the Linear API through the MCP protocol, enabling AI assistants to manage Linear issues and workflows.

## Core Requirements
1. Provide MCP tools for Linear API operations
2. Handle authentication via Linear API key
3. Support issue creation, updating, and searching
4. Enable comment addition to issues
5. Implement rate limiting to respect Linear's API limits
6. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback

## Goals
- Create a reliable interface between AI assistants and Linear
- Simplify Linear operations through standardized MCP tools
- Maintain compatibility with the MCP protocol specification
- Provide comprehensive documentation for users

## Project Scope
- **In Scope**: Linear API integration, MCP server implementation, basic error handling, rate limiting
- **Out of Scope**: UI development, authentication management beyond API key

## Timeline
- Initial development: Complete
- Release workflow: In progress
- Future enhancements: TBD

## Success Criteria
- All specified Linear operations work correctly through MCP tools
- Server handles errors gracefully
- Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- Release process is automated

# Progress: Linear MCP Server

## What Works
1. **Core MCP Server**:
   - Server initialization and configuration
   - Tool registration and execution
   - Error handling and response formatting

2. **Linear API Integration**:
   - Authentication via API key
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - API request and response handling

3. **MCP Tools**:
   - `linear_create_issue`: Creating new Linear issues
   - `linear_update_issue`: Updating existing issues
   - `linear_search_issues`: Searching for issues with various criteria
   - `linear_get_user_issues`: Getting issues assigned to a user
   - `linear_get_issue`: Getting a single issue by ID
   - `linear_add_comment`: Adding comments to issues
   - `linear_get_teams`: Getting a list of teams

4. **Testing**:
   - Test fixtures for all tools
   - HTTP interaction recording and playback

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority
1. **Release Automation**:
   - ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for testing and releases
   - Testing the workflow with a real release

### Medium Priority
1. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Update README with release information
   - Add CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
   - Add examples of using the server with different AI assistants

2. **Additional Linear API Features**:
   - Support for managing issue labels
   - Support for managing issue attachments
   - Support for managing issue relationships

### Low Priority
1. **Infrastructure Improvements**:
   - Docker container support
   - Configuration file support
   - Improved logging and metrics

## Current Status
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Stability**: Stable for core features
- **Test Coverage**: Good, all tools have test fixtures
- **Documentation**: Basic documentation in README.md
- **Release Process**: In progress, GitHub Actions workflow created

## Known Issues
1. **API Key Management**:
   - API key must be provided as an environment variable
   - No support for other authentication methods

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Some error messages could be more descriptive
   - No retry mechanism for transient errors

3. **Feature Limitations**:
   - Limited support for Linear API features
   - No support for webhooks or real-time updates

## Recent Milestones
- ✅ Initial implementation of all core tools
- ✅ Test fixtures for all tools
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for testing and releases

## Upcoming Milestones

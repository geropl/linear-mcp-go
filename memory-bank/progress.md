# Progress: Linear MCP Server

## What Works
1. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - Cobra-based command structure
   - Subcommand support (server, setup)
   - Consistent flag handling

2. **Core MCP Server**:
   - Server initialization and configuration
   - Tool registration and execution
   - Error handling and response formatting

3. **Linear API Integration**:
   - Authentication via API key
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - API request and response handling
   - Proper JSON structure handling for API responses
   - Correct GraphQL parameter types for API validation
   - Proper resolution of human-readable identifiers to UUIDs

4. **MCP Tools**:
   - `linear_create_issue`: Creating new Linear issues with support for:
     - Sub-issues using parent issue ID or human-readable identifier (e.g., "TEAM-123")
     - Label assignment using label IDs or names
     - Team specification using team ID, name, or key
   - `linear_update_issue`: Updating existing issues
   - `linear_search_issues`: Searching for issues with various criteria
   - `linear_get_user_issues`: Getting issues assigned to a user
   - `linear_get_issue`: Getting a single issue by ID
   - `linear_add_comment`: Adding comments to issues
   - `linear_get_teams`: Getting a list of teams

5. **Setup Automation**:
   - Binary discovery and download
   - Configuration file management
   - Support for Cline AI assistant

6. **Testing**:
   - Test fixtures for all tools
   - HTTP interaction recording and playback
   - Comprehensive test coverage for enhanced functionality

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority
1. **Setup Command Testing**:
   - Test on different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Verify configuration file creation
   - Test binary download functionality

### Medium Priority
1. **Additional AI Assistant Support**:
   - Research other AI assistants for Linear integration
   - Implement support for these assistants
   - Update documentation

2. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Add CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
   - Add examples of using the server with different AI assistants
   - Add troubleshooting section

3. **Additional Linear API Features**:
   - Support for managing issue attachments
   - Support for managing issue relationships

### Low Priority
1. **Infrastructure Improvements**:
   - Docker container support
   - Configuration file support for server
   - Improved logging and metrics
   - Automatic binary updates

## Current Status
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Stability**: Stable for core features
- **Test Coverage**: Good, all tools have test fixtures
- **Documentation**: Updated with new command structure and setup instructions
- **Release Process**: GitHub Actions workflow created
- **Security**: Write access control implemented (disabled by default)
- **User Experience**: Improved with setup command and user-friendly identifiers

## Known Issues
1. **API Key Management**:
   - API key validation only happens on first API request
   - No support for other authentication methods

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Some error messages could be more descriptive
   - No retry mechanism for transient errors
   - Network errors during setup could be handled better

3. **Feature Limitations**:
   - Limited support for Linear API features
   - No support for webhooks or real-time updates
   - Limited AI assistant support (currently only Cline)

## Recent Milestones
- ✅ Initial implementation of all core tools
- ✅ Test fixtures for all tools
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for testing and releases
- ✅ Write access control implementation (--write-access flag, default: false)
- ✅ Command-line interface with subcommands
- ✅ Setup command for AI assistants
- ✅ Enhanced `linear_create_issue` tool with support for sub-issues and labels
- ✅ Implemented user-friendly identifiers for parent issues and labels
- ✅ Fixed JSON unmarshaling issue with Labels field
- ✅ Added support for team key in issue creation
- ✅ Fixed label resolution issue with GraphQL parameter type
- ✅ Fixed parent issue identifier resolution for human-readable identifiers

## Upcoming Milestones
